  desc: "Smart objects and cameras are trending. They bring practicality and perceived security but also raise vulnerability (even giants like Google and Amazon have had breaches). Our questions aim to show how cameras are being used and misused. The invisible eyes may be around the corner, in a bedroom or even in the very device you’re reading this into."

  desc: "This research discusses the slightly underrated phenomenon of memetic warfare. There is increasing evidence to suggest that this practice works as the propaganda of the contemporary media landscape. Therefore, we map how memes can be strategically turned into tools for psychological warfare."

  Anna Gazza, Barbara Vanoli"
  desc: "Online censorship is a complex phenomenon that changes based on the typology of platform and content. The more the censorship involves users, the more it becomes discussed: why are some contents censored? Who censors them? Which is the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate content?"

  desc: "Global spread of body and face modification apps and the ease of use of them in recent years have raised concerns and controversies, such as privacy matters of use of personal images, edited bodies encouraging body dysmorphia, and beauty racist bias. The project aims to provide an overview through different perspectives on the subject, ranging from the public discussion to the way face and body modification apps appear."

  desc: "Recently there has been a lot of commotion around an emerging technology called Deepfake. This artificial technology based on deep learning allows the manipulation of content up to concerning levels of realism. This research digs into different platforms to explore the current situation around Deepfake."

After the acceleration of informational consumption, dating apps have become a normal part of life. But how do they work, what do they ask of us and what kind of problems do they create?"

In the second phase of the course students learn how to make use of online data to study social and cultural phenomena: in a question-driven process, each group design protocols for data collection and analysis and produce research findings using data visualizations. At the end of the phase each group design an interactive research report.

Each designed report analyzes a specific issue: memetic warfare, visual misinformation, dating and fake profiles, face recognition and its countermeasures, deep fakes and synthetic media, the effects of digital platforms on the visual representation of cities, visual censorship online, drones and aerial mapping, apps for face and body modifications.

In all, they offer a critical overview of how digital technologies are blurring the boundaries between real and fake.
