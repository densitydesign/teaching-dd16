“MAGA” is an acronym used by Trump supporters to refer to his “Make America Great Again” slogan. Even though the Million MAGA March had been suggested a few times previously, it was right after Biden’s victory that people started to use it to organize a march in Washington, D.C. on the 14th, and protest against what they believed to be election fraud.
