In 2018, the hashtag #SaveTheChildren was mainly used to inform people about the work of the Save The Children NGO, as well as to tag some actual problems, such as children refugees. When used, it was associated with the official @SaveTheChildren handle, official links to the NGO website, and retweeted by famous personalities, such as the Mexican journalist Chumel Torres.
