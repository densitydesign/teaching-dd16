  Videos on YouTube gain traction when they appear on most search results.
  Customising titles and adding keywords that game YouTubeâ€™s algorithm rank such
  videos higher. However, YouTube updates its algorithm constantly and has made
  several changes in recent times to suppress clickbait titles. The data here
  studies how this channel has attempted to adapt to these changes over the
  years.

    <h2>Finding 1</h2>
    <p>
      There is a typical format used in the titles of the 50 thumbnails of top
      most popular videos each year from 2016 to 2020 and it shows a standard
      pattern of: Number + Adjective + Noun, and this pattern alters in various
      ways every year.

    <p>
      The formats of these titles keep changing from complex to simple to
      complex again through all the five years. The formats in 2017 and 2018 are
      maintained more or less the same.

      The titles in 2016 end with the channel name. However, from 2017 onwards
      this pattern was dropped. From 2017, more search-friendly, keyword-rich
      titles were created and uppercase words were used.

    <h2>Finding 4</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2019, the channel attempts to reinforce their messaging by using a
      structure that repeats specific types of words such as an adjective then a
      noun, and then another adjective. This creates full titles of what you
      would see, the problems it solved and what you would learn.
