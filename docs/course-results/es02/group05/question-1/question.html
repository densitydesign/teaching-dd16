<p class="intro-text">
  Objectification of women in the media is not a new concept. However, given the
  channel’s large audience of 70 million subscribers and billions of views, the
  phenomenon takes an uncomfortable turn. This research seeks to answer if
  certain body parts have more appeal than others and subconsciously or
  consciously affect the viewer’s decision to click on it.

  <div class="finding">
    <h2>FINDING 1</h2>
    <p>
      In the thumbnails of the last 200 videos uploaded on the channel, it was
      found that more than half of them contain a female body part, and on the
      other hand, a negligible percentage contain male body parts.

    <h2>FINDING 2</h2>
    <p>
      Counting by average number of views per video, the ranking of most watched
      videos from high to low is: lips, then bust, breasts, whole body, hair,
      nails, hands, face, buttocks, legs and back.

  <div class="finding">
    <h2>FINDING 3</h2>
    <p>
      The most-watched videos are those with thumbnails containing breasts and
      open mouth which are female body parts that are associated with
      intimacy/sexuality, indicating that the views could be higher because of
      the visual trigger that suggests sexual connotations, even though it does
      not directly relate to sexuality.

  <div class="finding">
    <h2>FINDING 4</h2>
    <p>
      Certain body parts such as the lips, are used in a small number of
      thumbnails but those videos have gained substantially more views, whereas
      other generic body parts such as the hands or nails although have been
      used frequently but have a low number of average views per video.
