subtitle: Exploring elements that boost views in content farms (besides the content)
description: "
The 5-minutes craft channel contains content that violates YouTube policies such as misleading titles and thumbnails. They are infamous for designing thumbnails to be loud, bold and provocative, generating an irresistible form of curiosity. What the image implies is most often not related to what the video contains, and what the video contains is impossible for any person to replicate. Viewers are aware of this, but does it stop them from clicking on the video? 

The 5-minutes crafts channel on YouTube is the platform’s biggest DIY channel with almost 60% of YouTube’s DIY views [1][2]. It can be classified as a content farm given its high volume of videos and repetitive content. But this seemingly has had a low effect on turning viewers away, as the channel boasts of a nearly 70 million subscriber base. They have conquered the YouTube algorithm with their absurd thumbnails and SEO-friendly keywords like “hacks” and “DIY”. On a platform with hundreds of similar creators, the 5-minutes crafts channel gets stranger each year to stand out from the crowd.

The aim here is to study what factors contribute to increased viewership, whether what we see on the surface and consider the obvious – provocative imagery and titles in all caps – are the only components to getting a viewer to click, and how something unapparent might subconsciously have an effect.
