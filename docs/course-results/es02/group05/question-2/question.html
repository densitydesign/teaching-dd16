<p class="intro-text">
  Social media often has a negative impact on self-esteem and mental health,
  especially for young women. This problem is influenced by many factors, among
  others the appearance and behavior of women promoted on such platforms.
  Content farms are strongly focused on profit, putting it below the well-being
  of the recipients. This research looks at the context in which women are
  portrayed in thumbnails of videos that reach millions of people.

    <h2>FINDING 1</h2>
    <p>
      In the dataset of 200 thumbnails, most of them contained women in various

      are portrayed in all of these contexts below.

    <h2>FINDING 2</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>FINDING 3</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the thumbnails showing housework portray women doing so and only a
      negligible number portray men. However, videos with thumbnails showing
      housework in which gender cannot be identified are more viewed.

      There are three categories of thumbnails that were found to portray only
      women: improving the appearance, eating unhealthy and being background to

      portrayals of women except one thumbnail that portrays a man.
