  Being a content farm, the thumbnails here play a huge role in attracting viewers.
  The expressions used in these thumbnails are both extremes of positive (happy/satisfied) and negative
  (angry/disgusted), mixed in with some neutral expressions. The aim here is to check if certain human expressions play
  a bigger
  role than others in affecting the viewer’s decision of clicking on it.

      FINDING 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      The channel started its first year with a small number of thumbnails containing human emotions, and then increased
      the frequency of use every year. “Happy” is the expression that is used the most.

      Happy is the expression that is used the most among all categories. These thumbnails are also the ones with most
      views on average per year, closely followed by satisfaction, making the positive category score the highest
      overall.

      FINDING 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first couple of years, positive emotions dominate these thumbnails. In the later years, it is seen that
      more
      expressions are included, especially in the final year where with all the expressions are present.

      FINDING 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      The majority of these thumbnails are split thumbnails, in that, the human emotions are added as a starting point
      and
      a result representation. Most often the contrast presented is that of a negative vs postive expression.
