title: It Looks Like a Conspiracy Theory

subtitle: How conspiracy theories use different visual languages to spread their messages online

description: "Conspiracy theories are living their Golden Age*: fostered by online platforms, social media and uncertain times, they have been spreading among people in different ways and through various channels. Some of the most recent theories have started to spread from user-generated content published online: for example, the hashtag #saveourchildren was used to share accusations to the Democrats, implying that they are a satanic pedophile ring, which is one of the theories supported by QAnon; Youtube has been recommending videos about the “Flat earth” theory to mass audiences** until in 2019 the company decided to change the algorithm to prevent their proliferation***. Despite various attempts by social media platforms to stop conspiracy theories-related content from spreading, these theories still widely circulate online. The research revolves around the aesthetic side of conspiracy theories by analyzing their form and visual language across different channels and platforms. The investigated sub-topics are: the look and feel of conspiracy theories-related posts on Instagram, the appearance of conspiraciy theories’ gadgets on Etsy, the inspiration behind Redbubble’s conspiracy theories-themed stickers and the usage of memes’ characters on 4chan posts. The research goal is to show how the crowdsourced nature of conspiracy theories affects the visual language in which they are expressed, which often references pop culture and borrows from several Internet subculture’s aesthetics."
