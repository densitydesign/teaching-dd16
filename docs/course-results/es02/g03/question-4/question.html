<p class="intro-text">
  Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic a lot of conspiracy theorists have been trying to point out some possible causes. Some of the main assumptions involve the advent of 5G, the spreading of GMOs or a plan to vaccinate the world population.
  Most of these topics are widely discussed on 4chan and often expressed using pictures and reinterpretations of fictional characters. This is a classification of the most recurrent ones from August to November 2020.
