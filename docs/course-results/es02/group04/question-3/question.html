  Dark tourism is a movement of people that travel to places historically associated with death and tragedy. We examined the #darktourism Instagram co-hashtags found in the pictures posted on the platform to define which topics are related to this kind of tourism. Every co-hashtag creates a network around itself that defines a sub-topic of dark tourism. Clusters are deeply related one to another and the distribution of relationships is overall homogeneous.</p>

Firstly, a few hashtags related to the main hashtag (#darktourism) are bigger because they are used by the majority of posts. These are #halloween, probably due to the fact that the research has been carried out at this specific time of the year , #travel, #history, #chernobyl. By looking at these terms we can get a sense of how the #darktourism hashtag is used. This kind of tourism is bound to traveling and exploring a place because of its history of death, but it is also associated with fictional and paranormal activities, tying it to a creepy imaginary.</p>

There are several topics derived from the specific use of co-hashtags. The topic is highlighted by the close relationship between co-hashtags. “Nuclear sites” is the category that contains the most used co-hashtags. This means that when looking for dark tourism the probability of encountering an image that concerns Nuclear sites is very high.</p>

Some of the hashtags do not come from English speaking countries: the most present languages after English are Spanish and Korean. In Spanish the hashtag is a direct translation to the language and its represented by the words “turismo” (tourism) and “negro, oscuro” (black, dark). In Korean, words associated to the imagery like “다크투어리즘 ” and “문화유산” are used to express respectively “dark tourism” and “cultural heritage”.</p>

Dark tourism is linked to travel and places where death is the common denominator. We would have expected to find places like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ground Zero, Hiroshima & Nagasaki because they are renowned places for death. However the most recurring historical moments linked to Dark tourism on Instagram are the Cambodian Genocide and the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
