subtitle: Exploiting Instagram data to understand how the platform influences our travel choices.

description: "«I think a lot about social media's role in tourism. Now you can almost curate your whole experience based on the images you see online, and it’s an unnatural approach to travel. It makes me wonder what happened to exploration.» Chris Burkard, photographer (@chrisburkard - 3.6M followers).
Instagram forever changed the way we approach traveling and tourism digital advertising. Have you ever been to a place just because of someone else’s picture on social media? We have, and it’s called social media-fueled tourism.
We noticed that people go out and care about some places because social media get them there, so some of them want to live the same experience and take the same photographs.
We decided to better understand why and how this happens. We have been using digital tools to analyze social media platforms (Instagram and TripAdvisor) in order to grasp the variety of tourism categories, to comprehend how a photographic trend spreads across different platforms and to single out specific types of tourism and investigate them thoroughly."
