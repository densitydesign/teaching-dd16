“Wait, I’ve seen that picture before! It’s trending on social media!” Instagram has rapidly and steadily changed the way we perceive places and choose our destinations. We analyzed three places that became popular around the world thanks to Instagram to understand how they became digitally and famous on TripAdvisor. Could a photographic trend boost tourism and challenge people to travel and take part in an iconic location?</p>

  <p>It is noticeable that the amount of posts related to a touristic location rises simultaneously and to the same extent on both platforms. This underlines how the two platforms are closely linked and that TripAdvisor comes always after Instagram. In addition to this, the photographic trend is fundamental in the growth of popularity on TripAdvisor, becoming a predominant aspect of the photos as time goes by.</p>

  <p>In Lempuyang Temple (Bali), the interest grows over time simultaneously on the two platforms. At the beginning of 2018 pictures start to be modified thanks to the use of a mirror behind the camera that reflects the image simulating a water pond. When the trend comes to life on Instagram at the same time the location goes viral on Tripadvisor. In fact, almost 50% of TripAdvisor’s photos between 2018 and 2019 follow the “mirrored picture” trend.</p>

  <p>At Pig Island in the Bahamas people are interested in taking pictures of themselves swimming together with pigs. At Pig Island we see the first increase in posts in 2014, but the real increment in popularity happens in the years 2016/2017, after a few famous people post their experiences at Pig’s Beach in 2016 (Amy Schumer). Before 2014 this place did not exist on Tripadvisor. It was later added due to popularity on Instagram, in fact the name itself comes from the pigs in the pictures.</p>

  <p>La casa del arbol or Swing at the End of the World saw increased popularity in the year 2014. In fact, in the same year a photographer named Sean Hacker Taper won a National Geographic contest with the picture of La casa del arbol. This picture represents a guy on a swing hanging in the air. Since then popularity rose and people continued to be photographed at the Swing at the End of the World.
