    From analyzing the different keywords used on the “#ProudBoys” hijacking of Twitter in different languages besides English, it is possible to observe that the type of accounts manifests differently across languages. For example, Italian was the only one to use the word “happy” in a relevant number.

    The use of emojis varies according to the language used, and the type of account. News accounts do not use a lot of emojis, and the ones they use are more neutral and less related to emotions. Personal accounts seem to use more emojis that represent emotions, not only pride symbols. LGBT organizations’ accounts tend to use more LGBT-related emojis than other kinds of emojis.

    A common keyword that is repeated across languages is “hashtag”, which might indicate that people are talking about the hijacking. It is also interesting to notice that most languages use the English word, apart from Danish and Japanese, that have a variation for it, and Spanish, that uses the word “etiqueta”, or “label” in English. In Portuguese and Japanese, besides “hashtag”, the shortened variation “tag” was also used.

    Moreover, some languages make use of alternative expressions to talk about a hijacking, probably because of the lack of a direct translation. For example, Spanish uses “to claim”, Portuguese and Japanese “to take over” and Dutch and Portuguese “to take away”.
