title: The invisible battleground of hashtag hijacking
subtitle: what can we learn by observing the dynamics of hashtags and the people who use them?

description: It is clear by now that social media platforms are, among a lot of other things, stages for debate and discussion. But with so much happening and so much content, it’s hard to keep track of what interests us. One way to do that, of course, is by using hashtags - they allow us to find content we enjoy, conversations we might appreciate, and like-minded people. They might be, nonetheless, like many things on the internet, vulnerable to a deviation from their original use. Spammers can use them to flood one’s feed with annoying content, unsatisfied customers might use it to flop a brand’s campaign and groups of people can use them to shift completely — and sometimes even drown out — a conversation. This research aims to observe the political use of the hashtag and tries to draw insights from the hijacking of specifically three of them, “#StopHateForProfit”, “#ProudBoys”, and “#millionMAGAmarch”. We collected data about their usage across different platforms and, through different analyses and visualizations, observed their differences, similarities, and the phenomenon itself. The project helped us to better understand the dynamics of hashtag hijacking, the people who do it, and even the way it happens on different platforms and languages. So what can we learn from these little tags people leave on their posts?
