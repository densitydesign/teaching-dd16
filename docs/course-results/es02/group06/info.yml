title: THE WEB CLEANERS
subtitle: What are the content moderators going through？

description: "The Wall Street Journal recently described content moderators as ‘the worst job in the US’. Thousands of content moderators are paid to view objectionable posts and decide which need to be removed from digital platforms. The research has been structured in the following three levels of depth to make people more aware of who content moderators are and how their situation is.The first part is the primary survey of the content moderators. How the demand for content moderators varies from country to country? What are the requirements for candidates? The second part studies the mental risk of content moderators declared in the job description. Many content moderators tend to suffer from mental illness because of the inevitable anti-social content from the internet. Have companies paid much attention to the mental health of content moderators? Finally, how do the public view content moderators’ problems caused by these mental impacts? Are these issues more visible or invisible on different social platforms?"
