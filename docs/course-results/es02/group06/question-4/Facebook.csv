Yes I did, Every company is working from home now anyway I could have managed to work from home in Kolkata as well but I don't want that because I don't want to be a part of an organisation whose so called influencers promotes acid attack In there videos, and by making a conspiracy they deleted carryminati's video from YouTube and that is really really bad and disgusting you guys know I'm working as a content moderator from last 2 years. I can earn money by working in several companies maybe I can earn little or large amount that doesn't matter but I can't it earn happiness neither I can buy happiness from anywhere which I used to get from carryminati's videos. I don't think he targeted any community or any groups, He said only to some private individuals who really deserve this. As you guys know I am a big fan of shahrukh khan as well he and his companies doing so many things for acid attack survivors and today's some so called social media influencers are promoting acid attacks over their videos.
