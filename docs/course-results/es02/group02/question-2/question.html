  On June 2020 the #WhiteoutWednesday was created to oppose the #BlackOutTuesday, but the hashtag was quickly hijacked by BTS stans and Twitter was flooded with posts.
  During a takeover, images play an important role because they reinforce the mockery of the original meaning.
  The research studies  visual content posted during the hijacking in order to identify recurrent and most popular features.

</p>
<hr />
<p>Posts hijacking the hashtag are significantly higher than those using it with the original meaning.

</p>

<p>Although Twitter was flooded with more than 9000 posts, only 1.25% of them became popular.
