TikTok is a new social platform that is becoming more and more popular. It introduced new visual formats for conveying information through the usage of short videos. Conspiracy theories as entertaining content have found in the platform a place in which their believer can share content and spread their ideas. Through the analysis of three different major hashtags related to conspiracy theories it can be highlighted if TikTok with its trend formats can influence the way users share conspiracy theories.

  Original content is the most used among all the three hashtags. This category includes videos in which people that are being recorded act quite spontaneously. In most of these videos, users frame themselves through the internal camera to explain their opinion about a particular topic. With the #Wayfair hashtag instead, it is often used for topics that are not related to the conspiracy. In fact, people use this kind of video to give an overview of a room, to show a particular piece of furniture or to document the process of furniture assembly.

    The conspiracy theory can influence the choice of the video format to use, since some video formats lend themselves better to some particular conspiracies. For example, the dance format is only used in #Freebritney. Users, in fact, sometimes record themselves dancing to the tune of Britney’s songs.

    Some video formats also fit better for specific purposes. For instance, in order to show evidence and explain them, users usually prefer to use the green screen in all the 3 hashtags. This format allows them to display different images in the background and at the same time to frame themselves while they’re discussing.

  In all the three hashtags, the most used video formats are used to spread more than one type of content. For example in #Covidhoax the original content trend format is used for nine different types of content.

  In each of the three hashtags an amount of video shares content not related to conspiracies, for doing this they use the same video formats as the one who aim at sharing the conspiracies.

  Not all the video formats are shared by the three hashtags, as in the case of the stitch format which is not present in the #freebritney hashtag.
