<p class="intro-text">
“Conspiracy Keanu” is a meme series starring the Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves. This series offers a pattern, represented by a fixed image and a recurring sentence structure. This template allows both to share already existing conspiracies and different objects to become subjects of new absurd conspiracy theories. In fact, it’s exactly by mixing the common rhetoric of conspiracies and the aesthetic of the meme that many people on social media manage to make jokes about different subjects and at the same time to raise existential questions that mimic the style of real conspiracy theories.

<div class="main-text-title">
  <h3>Main findings</h3>

<div class="main-text">
  <p>
   All the memes use a specific format: the template image is the same for every meme and the sentence is always structured in the same way, that refers to the rhetoric of conspiracies. The text, in fact, represents a sort of existential question, starting with “What if”.

  <p>
   Conspiracy Keanu Meme is mostly used to generate brand new theories, rather than to diffuse consolidated ones. In fact, it exploits the traditional rhetoric of conspiracies in order to turn different subjects into protagonists of new absurd conspiracy theories.

  <p>
   In general, the political sphere is the most targeted one. Many of the conspiracy theories represented through the meme, both recognized and brand-new, have politics-related subjects. However, even if they belong to the same category, the subjects used in Recognized and Brand-new theories are never the same. For instance, Donald Trump is often mentioned in relation to Recognized conspiracy, but he never appears as the protagonist of a Brand-New one.

  <p>
   Unlike the Politics category, entities related to the Entertainment and the Religion spheres are only mentioned in brand new theories.
