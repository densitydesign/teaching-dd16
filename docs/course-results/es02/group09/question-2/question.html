<p class="intro-text">
  Conspiracy theories are generated building a symbology around actions or objects. In particular, some items are so strongly linked to a conspiracy theory that their perception in people’s mind can change. Animals, technology, shapes but also people are taken out of their usual context and used to create an imagery for the conspiracy. Instagram, as a mainly visual social network, uses images, and in particular the object they represent, to vehicle a message. In order to have a general overview  we selected the 10 most influential conspiracy pages on Instagram.

  Some objects appear frequently in different categories of conspiracy theories. The most recurrent ones are of course the generic “Boy/Man/ Male” and “Girl/ Woman/ Female”, but also U.F.O. and Explosion/ Fire.

  The same object is sometimes part of the symbology of different conspiracy theories. According to the theory it refers to, the visual representation can change, but the object is still the same. For example, Donald Trump is the main subject for “covid-19 pandemic”, “death and disappearances”, “vaccinations”, and “false people” conspiracy theories.

  Of course a specific category of conspiracy theories uses images that represent more than one object, creating a real symbology around itself. For instance, in “covid-19 pandemic” images we can find Virus, Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Laboratory equipment, generic Male and Female figures and many other objects.
