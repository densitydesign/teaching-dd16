<p class="intro-text">
  Images, in order to convey messages related to conspiracy theories, are edited through different techniques. These interventions can modify the original meaning of an image and add possible layers of interpretation. Reddit was chosen as the research environment since the platform tends to stimulate debates around conspiracies using images as a starting point. Through the analysis of the images shared in the most followed subreddit regarding conspiracies is shown how much is the treatment of images used and which are the main techniques.

<div class="main-text">
  <p>
  Many of the images resulting from the research on r/conspiracy subreddit belong to conspiracy theories linked to current topics, such as Covid-19 and Epstein case. These are burning issues that fuel interesting debates on Reddit.

  Approximately half of the images analyzed are treated. However, some conspiracies tend to use more treated photos than others. For example among the QAnon-related images, in only 20% of them we can detect a visual treatment. On the other side, images related to “Cia involved with drugs” are all treated.

  <p>
  The most used technique among all categories is collage, which is employed in almost any category.

  <p>
  Some images present more than one type of treatment. It is quite common in fact to find photos in which more visual techniques have been applied. A popular combination, for example is collage and text application, typical of memes and other social media contents in which images are framed by a textual caption.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some categories of conspiracy do not present any treated images: Social Media censorship (0%), Riots (0%), Hollywood Sex Trafficking (0%), Juliane Assange (0%).
  </p>

  <p>
  Some categories of conspiracy present only (or almost only) treated images: 9/11 (90%), CIA Involvement with drugs (100%), P.S. Andrew Scandal (100%).
  </p>
    <img src="findings 1/Finding1_2-100.jpg"/>

    <p>
  In some categories, no-treated images seem to be more appreciated (they collected more points on Reddit): Epstein Case, News Manipulation, #Blacklivesmatter, Hong Kong protests, Bill Clinton sexual abuser, #Metoo.
    </p>
      <img src="findings 1/Finding1_4.gif"/>
      <hr />

      <p>
      In some other categories, treated images appear on average bigger, since they have received more points on Reddit: Pedophilia, 9/11, Human Trafficking, U.S. Army, Biden Allegations, White racism, Middle East War.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some images get to have even 4 different types of treatment. However this occurs just twice: in “Others” and "#Pizzagate".
      </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
        The addition of symbols and the Photoshopping are the less used techniques. The first one is mostly used in “CIA involvement with drugs” (30%), while the latter is mostly present in “Others” (10%).
        </p>
          <img src="findings 1/Finding1_5.gif"/>
          <hr />

          <p>
      In 75% of the images that use Photoshop technique, this treatment is not the only one used: in most of the cases Photoshopping is combined with Collage, Text or both of them.
          </p>
          <img src="findings 1/Finding1_6.gif"/>
          <hr />

          <p>
          The Addition of symbols is also rarely used alone: in 90% of those images, this technique is combined to another one (usually Collage, Text, Drawing or even all of them).
