<p class="intro-text">
  Conspiracy theories often communicate by using mass culture references such as movies, books, political issues, memes, etc; visual languages and imagery taken from various sources are reinterpreted in order to convey
  different messages.<br>
  We investigated this phenomenon by analyzing the e-commerce platform RedBubble, and especially in the “Stickers” section of the website, by searching using different queries related to popular conspiracy theories.
  We selected the top-50 best selling results for each query and grouped them into categories, in order to have an overview of the references and to spot the most recurrent ones.

  <h3>Main findings</h3>
</div>
<div class="">
  <p>
    The majority of the references on stickers are linked to the field of <mark>Entertainment</mark>, including slogans and images taken from <mark>dystopian</mark> or <mark>sci-fi</mark> movies and books: <mark>The Matrix, V for Vendetta, Men In
      Black</mark> etc.
    <mark>George Orwell’s 1984</mark> is the most recurrent reference, and it’s often adapted to mention relevant topics such as the Coronavirus pandemic, for example in the “<mark>COVID-1984</mark>” stickers. The queries that generated this
    reference are “<mark>mk ultra</mark>”, “<mark>pizzagate</mark>” and “<mark>5g</mark>”.

    Some stickers contain references to <mark>logos and trademarks</mark> of existing companies, which are edited to convey new messages. An interesting example is that of NASA, which is very recurrent and very recognizable (in most cases the text is
    the only
    difference from the original version). This reference is used to communicate different messages, from accusations to <mark>NASA</mark> (“<mark>LIES</mark>”) to slogans against flat earthers (“<mark>NOT FLAT</mark>”).

    In the <mark>Government&Politics</mark> section there are many references to the <mark>pyramid eye</mark>, a symbol related to <mark>US “One Dollar”</mark> banknotes which is commonly spread among different conspiracy theories (“<mark>mk
      ultra</mark>”, “<mark>pizzagate</mark>” and “<mark>qanon</mark>”).
    It’s also interesting how in one case the text of the sticker recalls just the font and the color from the banknotes.

  <p>
    In the <mark>Governments&Politics</mark> section there are many references to <mark>Donald Trump</mark> (either his figure or his political campaign MAGA) and some of his political opponents (<mark>Hillary Clinton</mark> and <mark>Joe
      Biden</mark>), most of which are related to the queries “<mark>qanon</mark>” and “<mark>pizzagate</mark>”.

  <p>
    In the <mark>Cult&Beliefs</mark> section the query “<mark>flat earth</mark>” generated references to religious content (such as the <mark>Bible</mark> and <mark>the YinYang sign</mark>), which is reused to represent the Flat Earth model.
  </p>

  <p>
    Almost a half of the stickers <mark>don’t contain any reference</mark> to mass culture, and they mostly consist in <mark>slogans</mark> and <mark>stock illustrations</mark>. A very common example is the sign of prohibition, very recurrent when
    using the query “<mark>5g</mark>”, which is the one that generated most results of stickers without references.

    Overall there aren’t fixed correlations between queries and categories, even though some themes are <mark>more recurrent</mark> when using specific queries.
    For example “<mark>qanon</mark>” and “<mark>pizzagate</mark>” generated more references to <mark>politics</mark> and <mark>movies</mark>, “<mark>flat earth</mark>” is more linked to <mark>NASA</mark> and the <mark>moon landing</mark>, while <mark>aliens</mark> and <mark>UFOs</mark> are the most common results when searching for “<mark>area 51</mark>” (that’s the reason why
    this query is particularly present in the <mark>Cult&Beliefs</mark> section).
