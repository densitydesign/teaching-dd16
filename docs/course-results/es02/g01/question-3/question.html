  Thumbnails are among the first elements that a user sees of a video and the only one that a kid of an early age could understand. Considering this, we collected all the thumbnails, from the first Cocomelon’s video published, even before the start of its fame, to October 30th 2020 (end of research) to see which strategies could be revealed and which elements were changed or kept in order to lead to their success ▎</p>

  <p>
    Cocomelon has been increasing the number of its publications over years. At the beginning, just a few videos were uploaded (in 2008 and 2009 no publication even occurred), then, from 2016 a change in strategy was evident, moving from 25 videos to a number of around 100 per year.

   The increase of publications also corresponds to a reduction in variability of main subjects presented and an increased repetition of the same format over time. The majority of the thumbnails of most recent years, from 2017 to 2020, present human figures as their main characters and they are similar even in colors, thus forming the big cloud at the centre of the visualisation.

  <p>
    From 2017, a slight change of strategy is evident: together with the passage to 3d images, thumbnails started focusing on characters’ centrality, presenting always recurrent layouts where few empty spaces are left from protagonists’ big faces.

    Standardisation of thumbnails could be seen not only in layout formats and subjects relevancy in the occupation of their space, but even in colors. A shift to warm tones is evident, in respect of early published videos.
